# platt2018

This is a personal repository (undocumented, scratch work) for fall 2018 work.

## OpenAI Gym

I'm starting out with a small evaluation of various methods against Cartpole v1.

* 4 questions as posed in https://openai.com/requests-for-research/#cartpole
** Random guessing (10k random)
** Hill climbing (start random, add noise, reevaluate)
** Policy gradient (not sure what the loss function is here)
** Implemented as a neural network?

### Notes

Policy gradient methods are covered in Ch. 13 of Sutton and Barto RL textbook.
(Includes actor-critic)

## Quickstart

(If you have a virtualenv: `source venv/bin/activate`
```
pip install gym
```
