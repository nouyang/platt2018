As another example, several loss functions like CrossEntropyLoss require that the target should be torch LongTensor. So before doing operations, make sure that your input Tensor types match the function definitions.

It is easy to convert the type of one Tensor to another Tensor. Suppose x and y are Tensor of different types. You can use x.type(y.type()) or x.type_as(y) to convert x to the type of y.
